# 1. 1-to-1 Relationship: Author and Book
# Scenario: Each book has a unique author, and an author writes only one book.
# Implement two classes: Author and Book.
# Define attributes like name for Author and title for Book.
# Ensure that a Book object is always associated with an Author object.
# Add a method to display the authorâ€™s name and their book title.


#Calling an Author in relation to their book 
class Author:
    def __init__(self,name):
        self.name = name 
    
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title,author):
        self. title = title
        self.author = author
        # self.author = author 
        
#Calling the Class 
#Object of the Author
a2= Author("Collins")
