# 5. Multi-Layered Relationship: Projects, Teams, and Members
# Scenario: A company manages multiple projects, each with a team of members. A member can belong to multiple projects.
# Create Project, Team, and Member classes.
# Define attributes like name for all three entities and team_members in Team.
# Implement methods to assign members to teams, assign teams to projects, and display all members of a project.
# Challenge: Ensure that a member cannot be assigned to the same team more than once and write a method to calculate the total number of unique members across all projects.
